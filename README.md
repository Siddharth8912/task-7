User Directory Web Application
This project is a simple yet stylish front-end application that fetches user data from a public API and displays it in a clean, responsive layout. It demonstrates the use of modern web technologies like the Fetch API, async/await, and CSS for creating dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.

üöÄ Getting Started
No complex setup or installation is required to run this project.

Ensure you have all three files in the same folder:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

üìñ How to Use
The user data will be fetched and displayed automatically when the page loads.

Click the Reload Data button to fetch a fresh list of users.

To test the error handling:

Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).

Go to the "Network" tab.

Find the throttling dropdown (it often says "No throttling") and select "Offline".

Click the "Reload Data" button on the page. You will see the error message appear.

Remember to set the network back to "No throttling" to restore the connection.
